      <p>Once you publish your courses for 2021-22, you’ll automatically gain permission to recruit trainees to them. This applies both to courses copied over from the current cycle and new courses you’ve added for 2021-22. You don’t need to contact the Department for Education to request permission directly. </p>

      <p>You only need to request permission for PE courses - you should have done this by 10 July 2020. If you haven’t done so, you won’t be able to run these courses during the 2021-22 cycle.</p>
