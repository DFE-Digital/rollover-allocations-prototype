      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Recruiting for the 2021-22 cycle</h1>

      <p>Once you publish your courses for 2021-22, you’ll automatically gain permission to recruit trainees to them. This applies both to courses copied over from the current cycle and new courses you’ve added for 2021-22. You don’t need to contact the Department for Education to request permission directly.</p>

      <p>Permission is only needed for fee-funded PE courses - accredited bodies should have requested this by 10 July 2020. If this hasn’t been done, you won’t be able to run these courses during the 2021-22 cycle. </p>
