      <p>All your courses, locations and details have been copied over from the current recruitment cycle (2020-21). You can now update them for 2021-22.</p>

      <p>You should: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>add any new courses</li>
        <li>delete courses you’re no longer running</li>
        <li>edit titles, outcomes and locations where necessary</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once you publish your courses for 2021-22, you’ll automatically gain permission to recruit trainees to them. This applies both to courses copied over from the current cycle and new courses you’ve added for 2021-22. You don’t need to contact the Department for Education to request permission directly.</p>

      <p>You only need to request permission for PE courses - you should have done this by 10 July 2020. If you haven’t done so, you won’t be able to run these courses during the 2021-22 cycle.</p>
